\chapter{Nucleophilic Substitutions and Elimination}
\section{Nucleophilic Substitutions (cont.)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{11/30:}Choosing between the mechanisms (cont.).
    \begin{enumerate}
        \setcounter{enumi}{3}
        \item Solvent.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Critical for borderline cases.
            \item The solvent is important for dissolving things/providing an environment for the reaction.
            \item There are two types of solvents: \textbf{protic} and \textbf{aprotic}.
            \item We need to know all of the common solvents (a table will be uploaded).
            \item Key difference between protic and aprotic solvents.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Protic solvents can do hydrogen bonding with anions (LGs), stabilizing them.
                \item Aprotic solvents cannot do this.
            \end{itemize}
            \item Protic solvents can stabilize \ce{X-}, easing the self-ionization step in S\textsubscript{N}1.
            \item Protic solvents stabilize both the nucleophile and LG in S\textsubscript{N}2.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item With the nucleophile retarded, the rate of S\textsubscript{N}2 goes down.
            \end{itemize}
            \item In an aprotic solvent, the nucleophile is even more reactive.
            \item Take-home message: For secondary alkyl halides (the borderline cases), protic solvents promote S\textsubscript{N}1 and aprotic solvents promote S\textsubscript{N}2.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Protic} (solvent): A solvent with an acidic proton.
    \item \textbf{Aprotic} (solvent): A solvent without an acidic proton.
    \item If you see a nucleophilic substitution-type reaction with just one compound surrounding the arrow, assume it is both the nucleophile \emph{and} the solvent.
    \item \textbf{Allylic} (carbocation): A carbocation on a carbon adjacent to an alkene.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Extra stable due to resonance stabilization.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{E1}: Unimolecular elimination.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Not a clean reaction --- E1 and S\textsubscript{N}1 often happen together.
        \item They will not ask us to tell which pathway is more favored.
        \item Features.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Tertiary alkyl halides are favored (secondary sometimes).
            \item Protic solvents are needed.
            \item We need a weak base/poor nucleophile.
            \item Selectivity: Determined by the alkene stability; we favor forming the more stable alkene (as per \textbf{Zaitsev's Rule}).
        \end{enumerate}
        \item E1 is not a useful reaction to prepare alkenes from alkyl halides since we get a mixture of products and there are selectivity issues.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Zaitsev's Rule}: More substituted alkenes are more stable.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For secondary carbons, $\text{cis}<\text{trans}<\text{geminal}$ in terms of stability.
        \item Since $sp^2$ is more electronegative than $sp^3$ and \ce{R} is an EDG, more \ce{R} groups can provide more electrons to stabilize the $sp^2$ carbons.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{E2}: Bimolecular elimination.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Often very selective, and you can make it very selective.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The lack of a carbocation intermediate and the fact that it's a concerted mechanism both contribute to the higher yield.
        \end{itemize}
        \item In order to realize E2, the conformation \emph{must} adopt \textbf{anti-periplanar geometry}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item E2 is a stereospecific reaction.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Anti-periplanar geometry}: Two groups of importance are opposite each other and lie in the same plane.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Consider the \ce{H} and \ce{X} in Figure \ref{fig:eliminationb}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Example: Consider \emph{cis}-1-chloro-2-isopropylcyclohexane in solution with \ce{MeONa} and \ce{MeOH}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Only the more stable cyclohexane conformation (with \ce{Cl} axial and \ce{Pr^{$i$}} equatorial) has hydrogens anti to the chlorine.
        \item Both of these hydrogens will undergo E2 elimination with the chlorine, and the trisubstituted product will be the major product (as per Zaitsev's rule).
        \item However, if we use $t$-butoxide instead of methoxide, the disubstituted product would be the major product due to sterics.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Example: Consider \emph{trans}-1-chloro-2-isopropylcyclohexane in solution with \ce{MeONa} and \ce{MeOH}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Since the less stable conformation is the reactive one, the reaction will still go, but it will be very slow.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Take-home summary: For E2, the first priority is anti-periplanar, and then Zaitsev.
\end{itemize}
