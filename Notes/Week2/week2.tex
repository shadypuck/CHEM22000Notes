        \item Goes through a number of examples.
        \item Acetonitrile is a strong polar solvent.

        \item Benzyl: \ce{Ph-CH2{-}}, \ce{C6H5CH2{-}}, \ce{Bn{-}}
        \item Compounds with \ce{R-Z} where Z is a heteroatom.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If Z is a halogen X, then the halogroup makes it an alkyl halide or haloalkane.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Alkenyl halide: \ce{X-=}.
        \item Aryl halide: \ce{Ph-X}.
        \item Alcohols or phenols: \ce{R-OH}.

\section{Discussion Section}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ACS in-text citations should be in superscripts as a list of number with no brackets or parentheses.
    \item Molecular formulas are \ce{C2H6O}, not \ce{C2H5OH} or \ce{CH3CH2OH}.
    \item Make a table if you have a lot of data to put in (make it readable!).
    \item Distillation:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We need a boiling chip and stir bar inside the flask.
        \item Vapor comes up from a round-bottomed flask, encounters a rubber stopper and gets diverted through a condenser instead.
        \item Make use of countercurrent exchange and increase pressure by inflowing water in the gravitationally lower portion of the condenser.
        \item Boiling chip is a coarse material with a lof of micropores inside.
        \item The surface energy is reduced when the fluid is inside the micropores; within, it can more easily become a gas.
    \end{itemize}
    \item As the mole fraction $\chi$ of a substance \ce{A} increases\dots
    \item Raoult's law:
    \begin{equation*}
        P_\text{total} = \frac{P_A\chi_A}{P_B\chi_B} = \frac{P_A\chi_A}{P_B(1-\chi_A)}
    \end{equation*}
    \item Dalton's law: The total pressure is equal to the sum of the partial pressures.
\end{itemize}



\section{Intermolecular Forces and IR Spectroscopy}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{10/12:}Intermolecular forces and physical properties.
    \item \textbf{Boiling point}: The temperature at which the vapor pressure is equal to the pressure of the atmosphere above.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The stronger the intermolecular forces, the higher the boiling point.
        \item The higher the molecular weight, the higher the boiling point.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Melting point}: The temperature at which the crystalline solid and liquid are in equilibrium.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The stronger the intermolecular forces, the higher the melting point.
        \item The more symmetrical, the higher the melting point.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Solubility.
    \item Intermolecular forces.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item All electrostatic attractions related to bond polarity.
        \item 3 types: Dipole-dipole forces, hydrogen bonding, and dispersion forces.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dipoloe-dipole forces}: Attraction between opposite poles ($\SIrange[per-mode=symbol]{1}{3}{\kilo\calorie\per\mole}$).
    \item \textbf{Hydrogen bonding}: Dipole-dipole interaction between \ce{H}-atoms bonded to \ce{O}, \ce{N}, \ce{F} ($\SIrange[per-mode=symbol]{2}{10}{\kilo\calorie\per\mole}$).
    \item \textbf{Dispersion forces}: Weak ($<\SI[per-mode=symbol]{1}{\kilo\calorie\per\mole}$). Momentary distortion of the electron cloud (temporary dipole). Induces dipoles in surrounding molecules. \emph{Also known as} \textbf{London forces}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Depends on relative polarizability, i.e., how far valence electrons are from the nucleus.
    \end{itemize}
    \item IR spectroscopy: The frequencies absorbed vary based on the type. Higher stretching freqencies for lighter atoms and stronger bonds.
\end{itemize}
