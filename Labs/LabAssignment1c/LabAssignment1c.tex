    \item Information in common:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Molecule identifying information.
        \item The IR Spectrum from the SDBS database has data for much higher wavenumbers than the IR Spectrum from NIST.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Carbonyl data:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Based on the IR spectra, benzophenone may have a carbonyl since we have a peak in the vicinity of $\SIrange{1710}{1735}{\per\centi\meter}$ although not strictly at it. This carbonyl is part of a ketone, and the wavenumber of the peak (from Figure \ref{fig:IRSpectrum}) is $\SI{1666}{\per\centi\meter}$. This is consistent with the fact that benzophenone does have a carbonyl.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Alcohol/amine data:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Based on the IR spectra, benzophenone has neither an alcohol nor an amine since neither spectrum shows a peak at either $\SI{3400}{\per\centi\meter}$ or $\SI{3300}{\per\centi\meter}$, respectively. This is consistent with the fact that benzophenone has neither an alcohol nor an amine.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Alkyne/nitrile data:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Based on the IR spectra, benzophenone has neither an alkyne nor a nitrile since neither spectrum shows a peak from $\SIrange{2100}{2300}{\per\centi\meter}$. This is consistent with the fact that benzophenone has neither an alkyne nor a nitrile.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Most prominent \ce{C-H} absorption peak:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The $sp^2$ \ce{C-H} peak, just to the left of $\SI{3000}{\per\centi\meter}$, is the most prominent (and only) \ce{C-H} peak. This is consistent with the fact that benzophenone has only $sp^2$ \ce{C-H} bonds (no $sp^3$ or $sp$ \ce{C-H}) and, in fact, only $sp^2$ hybridized carbons.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Other prominent stretches:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There appears to be some aromatic activity in the vicinity of $\SI{1500}{\per\centi\meter}$, owing to benzophenone's two aromatic rings. Consistent with the structure, there is not other distinguishing activity.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
